## Task 1-1

As shown, two examples can demonstrate the strength of the simple nearest neighbor greedy algorithm  

- Example:

For both side, the simple nearest neighbor greedy algorithm can find the optimal solution.

## Task 1-2

As shown, two examples can demonstrate the importance of the choice of a start city 

- Example:

As shown, the choice of a start city can affect the final solution. Path shown in the right figure is a bad solution. If the start city is chosen as the city 1, the path will be the optimal solution.
